# Reproducibility and Replicability of Web Measurement Studies
This repository holds additional material to the paper "Reproducibility and Replicability of Web Measurement Studies" submitted to the ACM Web Conference 2022.

The repository is organized as follows:
* In `01_Plots`, one finds all codes and the underlying data used to produce the plots in the paper
* In `02_Data`, we provide a link to the raw measurement results.
* In `03_Framework`, one can find the framework we used for our measurement study.
* In `04_Paper_Survey`, we provide a listing of all analyzed papers.
* Finally, in `05_misc`, we provide further data (e.g., the used _EasyList_, _list of visited pages_).
